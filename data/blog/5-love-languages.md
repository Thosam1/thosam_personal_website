# Introduction

This is actually the second time I am reading this book. 

Looking at myself and my past relationship, I realize that I can improve on my behaviors and how I  approach love. When I first started reading this book, I was desperate and in search for answers on how love could be communicated in a relationship. I wanted to know where I failed to communicate my love.

As I turned each page and read the chapters, I noticed many interesting points were mentioned. Insights that resonated with me and made me realize that indeed, there are things that I can change.

I hope that you will enjoy reading this book as much as I did and will grow into a better version of yourself. 😄 

This book helps you better understand the people around you and yourself.

# What happens to love after the wedding

In this chapter, the author explains that similar to having spoken languages: French, English, German, … There are 5 love languages (with their respective dialects 😆).

People tend to speak generally in their own native language because it is the language we feel the most comfortable in, and thus communicate with the love language they are the most familiar with.

The author argues that one of the main reason why love fade after a marriage is because couples fail to understand each other’s love language and thus fail to communicate love in a way that is appreciated and felt by the spouse. What makes one person feel loved emotionally is not always the thing that makes another person feel loved emotionally.

Therefore, we must put in the effort to learn to communicate and understand other people’s love language.

# Keeping the love tank full

The need to feel loved is a primary human emotional need. For love we would do anything, from climbing mountains to crossing seas. Without love, everything become unbearable.

Love is essential to our emotional well-being. This search for love starts from children, they need love and affection. When children do not feel wanted, they seek love in the wrong places and in the wrong ways. The metaphor of the “love tank” refers to having your emotional needs met.

People have the desire to be intimate and to be loved by another. Therefore the author highlights that making efforts to keep this love tank full is the key to a lasting marriage.

I personally think that the author makes a good point. This concept of “love tank” and making efforts in order to meet the other person’s emotional needs is important for all kinds of relationships. Whether we got children, brothers, sisters, parents or friends, I think it is important to keep this picture of a love tank in our mind. Everyone wants to feel loved and appreciated. Whenever we interact with someone, we can try being more attentive to the o’ther person’s “love tank”, especially when the other person matters to you.

# Falling in love

When we fall in love, everything seems so magical. We feel amazing, we think about that person day and night, we are *obsessed*. This “in-love” experience is euphoric. At our eyes, the other person seems so perfect and it is hard to believe anything else. We become willing to do anything for the benefit of our lover, we are guided by this “in-love” experience, we become irrational.

We wrongly believe that this amazing feeling, this happiness will last forever. Dr. Dorothy Tennov conducted studies on the “in-love” phenomenon and she concluded that the average lifespan of a romantic obsession is 2 years. After this, reality will set in and the little bumps we overlooked when we were in love now become huge mountains. We begin to assert ourselves, we will express our desires but they will differ. Little by little, this illusion of intimacy evaporates. 

Interestingly, data shows that the divorce rate of second marriages are higher than those of first marriages. Divorce rate of third marriages are even higher. 

The obsession we feel at the beginning is ephemeral and if marriage was a book, it would only be the introduction.  When reality sets in and the “in-love” experience has run its course, this is the moment where “real” love can begin. A love that unites reason and emotion. It requires responsibility and discipline from both people to make this work, also recognizes the need for personal growth. This the moment where we “choose” to love the other person, not just out of instinct or emotion. We must find appropriate ways to express this decision. 

“How do we meet each other’s deep, emotional need to feel loved ?” Keeping the love tank full is essential to a happy relationship.

# Love language #1: Words of affirmation

Words of affirmation are basically ways to formulate *verbally* our love. They are generally express in a simple and straightforward way: 

“You look look incredible in this dress.”

“I really like how you’re always on time.”

“Thank you for xxx, I want you to know that I don’t take that for granted.”

“I want you to know that I really appreciate you doing this for me.”

There are 4 main dialects in which we can communicate words of affirmation:

- verbal compliments
- encouraging words
- kind words
- humble words

## Verbal compliments

Verbal compliments are very important, they are better motivators than nagging words ! 

## Encouraging words

To *encourage* means “to inspire courage”. We all have areas in which we feel insecure. We lack courage and this lack of courage often hinders us from reaching our potential. We should encourage people through our words. This can really make an impact and really change someone’s perspective, inspiring them to take the first step.

Encouragement requires empathy and seeing the world from the other person’s perspective. We must first learn what is important to our spouse. This is important because it should has to do with something that the other person *desires*, without that, the words will come across as judgmental and guilt inducing. 

With verbal encouragement, we are trying to communicate: “I know, I care. I am with you. How can I help ?” We are trying to show that we believe in his/her abilities.

## Kind words

Kind words has to do with the way we speak. We should have a gentle and soft tone of voice.

When our spouse is upset, we can practice compassion. We can choose to love and seek to put ourselves in their shoes, seeing the events through their eyes and then express softly why we think they feel that way. If we have wronged them, we can ask for forgiveness. If we have another point of view, we will explain our motivation kindly. Therefore, we will seek *understanding* and *reconciliation*, not to prove that our perception is the only logical interpretation.

None of us is perfect. Love doesn’t bring back past failures. Sometimes we say or do hurtful things to our spouse. We cannot erase the past, we can only confess and agree that it was wrong. We can only ask for forgiveness and try to improve for the future. “You are not a failure because you have failed.”

## Humble words

Love make requests, not demands. If we are to develop an intimate relationship, we need to know each other’s desires. If we wish to love each other, we need to know what the other person wants. However, the way we express those desires is crucial. They should not come across as demands because this will erase any possibility of intimacy. We must instead give guidance in what we would like:

“Could you xxx ?”

“Do you think it will be possible for you to xxx ?”

 When we make a request to someone, we are affirming his/her abilities to do something that is meaningful and worthwhile for us. Love is always a choice and this is what makes it meaningful. When we make a request we offer the choice to respond or deny the request. Therefore requests create the possibility to express love, to communicate that we respect and care about someone, to do something that pleases him/her, whereas demands destruct any possibility of intimacy. 

## Practicing

This deep need to feel appreciated, we all have it inside of us. Words of affirmation are one way to meet the need to feel appreciated. 

The first thing we can do to improve is to collect those words or sentences in a list whenever we hear or read words of affirmation. This way, we can take inspiration from this collection in order to communicate our love to people.

We can also use indirect words of affirmation, when the person is not present, we could express our gratitude or appreciation towards this person to other people. Likewise, we can also praise the person in a public setting, in front of others (parents, friends, colleagues). For example, when given public honor for an accomplishment we can share the credit with your parter. The thing to remember, is that verbal appreciation is not only limited when we are with our partner in a 1 on 1 setting !

Written words of affirmation through letters, post-it and text messages have the great benefit that they can be read over and over again. 

To help getting started with practicing, we can start by expressing  verbal appreciation for things we like about the other person, list of positive traits, qualities, strengths. This list should be as specific as possible. This way, the words of affirmation are straightforward.

In addition to that, don’t forget that you can just thank your mate for something they do routinely and wouldn’t expect to be complimented for !

> *What would you most like your spouse to say to you ?*
> 

This question is actually very interesting.

I would like to feel appreciated. Appreciated for the efforts I make to show love, to become a better person. I would like to receive constructive feedback. I realize that I am not good at communicating my appreciation towards other people. I am not fluent in this language. Most of the time I really do feel grateful inside but it’s only painted in my mind. Sadly, other people cannot read my mind. Therefore, I also need to work on those aspects. By practicing every day at communicating love through my words.

# Love language #2: Quality time

Quality time means to focus on the other person, to give someone our ***undivided attention***, looking at each other and talking with devices put away, doing an activity together that the other person enjoys (and doing it *wholeheartedly*). Just being in the same room with someone is not enough, our attention should be focused on that one person we are spending time with, only then can we call it “being together”. 

Spending time on an activity together while focused on each other is what creates the sense of togetherness. The activity is not what matters, **what matters is that in this moment, we are spending time with each other** → We must see the bigger picture ! 

Time is a precious commodity. When we sit down with our partner, and give each other our undivided attention. We are giving each other minutes of life ! We will never have those minutes again. Therefore, we are giving our lives to each other ! Quality time takes a whole other meaning, we can communicate love through quality time. It communicates that we care about each other, that we enjoy being with each other, that we like to do things together !

## Quality Conversations

For someone whose primary love language is quality time, having a sympathetic dialogue where both individuals share their respective **experiences**, **thoughts**, **feelings** and **desires** in a friendly and **uninterrupted context** is crucial to his or her emotional sense of being loved.

Words of affirmation focus on what we are saying, whereas quality conversations focus on what we are hearing.

When we share love through means of quality time - conversations - we must listen well, because the goal is to understand the other person’s **thoughts**, **feelings** and **desires**. We want to communicate love by focusing on the other person, *understanding them* and showing them that we understand their perspective.

### Learning how to listen

We must learn to listen well. In today’s world, we are trained to analyze problems and create solutions. We sometimes make the mistake of only listening long enough to hear the problem and formulate a solution. However, a relationship is not a project or a problem to solve. A relationship requires sympathetic listening with a genuine desire to understand the other person’s **thoughts**, **feelings** and **desires**.

We should only give advice when it is requested and only in a kind manner.

### Learning how to talk

Quality conversation not only requires sympathetic listening but also self-revelation. For intimacy to happen, we must share what we are thinking or feeling to our mate. For many people, especially those who grew up in homes where expressing thoughts, feelings and desires where not encouraged, this does not come naturally. Because we have learned to deny our feelings and thus are no longer in touch with our emotional selves.

However, to have intimacy, we must learn to reveal ourselves, to get in touch with our own feelings. “What emotions have I felt in the last 3 hours ?” We can recall an event and the feelings associated with it.

Self-revelation is the act of showing your private thoughts, opinions, or feelings. By communicating regularly to your mate about your own feelings and thoughts, this process will come more naturally.

## Quality Activities

These are activities that generally interests one or both of the partners. However, the emphasis is not on what we are doing but on *why* *we are doing it*.

The purpose is to experience something together, to walk away from it feeling like “he cares about me”. He is willing to do something with me that I enjoy and he did it with a *positive attitude*.

By sharing quality activities, it provides us with a **memory bank** from which to draw in the future. Those are **memories of love**, especially for someone whose primary love language is quality time.

## Practice

### Conversations

- Listening for feelings.

What is the other person thinking ? feeling ? what are their desires ?

What emotion is he/she experiencing ?

When we have an idea, we can confirm it: “It sounds to me like you are feeling disappointed because I forgot xxx”

Or we can ask questions for clarification to make sure that we know what they are thinking / feeling.

This allows the other person to clarify his/her feelings but also communicates that we are actively listening to what they are saying and that we are trying to understand them. This is great because we communicate that we understand their feelings.

- Observing body language

We can pay attention to their body language, tone of voice, facial expressions, eye brows, eye movements, hands, legs. Observing the person while listening to them can give us clues as to what they are feeling. Because sometimes, words can speak one message while body language speaks another.

- Offering non verbal cues

Likewise, we can also offer them non verbal cues to communicate that we are listening and giving them our full undivided attention. This can be done via: regular eye contact, nodding, attentive posture (facing towards them), eye brows, mouth (eg: open), hands (eg: hands over the head).

- Refuse to interrupt

This means that we should listen, while the other person is talking. We should not think about what we are going to say while they are still talking. We should refrain from defending ourselves, stating our position or hurling accusations at him/her while they are talking. **The objective is to first seek and discover their thoughts and feelings**. Only then, can there be a constructive discussion. 

- Get rid of distractions

Don’t listen to them while doing something else. You want to give them full attention. If you are doing something else, you could say: “I know that you are trying to talk to me, I am interested but right now I cannot give you my full attention. If you give me 10 minutes to finish what I am doing, I will sit down and listen to you”. 

### Awareness

“What emotions have I felt in the last 3 hours ?” 

We can recall an event and the feelings associated with it, then write it down somewhere or communicate those to someone.

If we do this 3 times a day, after a few weeks, we will become comfortable expressing our emotions with our partner.

→ eg: every day, each talk about 3 things that happened and how they feel about them, this could be done during dinner for example.

### Activities

This can be done through activities such as: taking a walk, going out to eat, looking at each other and talking. It’s important to plan those times together.

- Spending a weekend in the mountains
- Meeting for lunch
- In the evening, sitting down together and talk about each other’s day
- Going on a picnic
- Taking a vacation together
- Going for a walk and talk
- …

What is essential is that: 

1. At least one of us wants to do it (we can set time aside  to do something they enjoy/interests them ^^)
2. The other is willing to do it
3. Both of us know why we are doing it (to express love by being together)

> What in your marriage detracts from spending quality time ?
> 

I think what prevents me personally is that I have some progress to do in communicating/sharing my emotions, thoughts, feelings and desire. To open up faster but also formulate them in a kind manner. I realize that I tend to go back into my shell and raise walls. This I think would be what prevents quality time.
